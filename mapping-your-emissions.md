# Mapping your emissions

The 2050 Calculator works by splitting up the energy and emissions system of a country or region into different sectors, modelling the energy demand, supply and emissions in each across a 40 year period, and then adding them all together to show the total figures. 

The first step is to decide how to divide up the energy and emissions system, and this will depend on the particular economy you are looking at and what you want to find out. For example, residential heating is a major source of energy demand in the UK due to the mild climate. In a country like Thailand, air conditioning will be a more important area to focus on, so cooling would be a more appropriate choice.  If a sector is not relevant to you (for example wave power in a land-locked country), do not include it. 

In the UK calculator, industry was modelled as one sector, but the calculator of the Belgian region of Wallonia split industry into a variety of sectors so it could be more accurately modelled. The Indian calculator splits electricity supply into low-carbon technologies and conventional technologies, which the team decided was a very useful distinction for reporting results.  Or the Chinese split of rural and urban transport. NEED TO ADD MORE INFO HERE  

In general you should aim to have as few sectors as possible so that it is quick to use the tool, but you must include all the sectors that people expect, even if they are small (for example, if most people think that rooftop wind turbines are an important potential energy source, then it should be included even if this is factually incorrect).  

For reference, here is a list of the sectors that most calculators so far have used:

## Mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive (MECE) 

The different sectors in the energy economy obviously overlap and interact with each other to produce overall supply, demand and emission figures. It is crucial to understand this interplay and to take it into account when designing the model, but not to get overwhelmed by it. Everything should be covered once, but once only. The MECE principle (mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive) should become a mantra for the project, so that the same energy or emissions inputs do not appear multiple times in the model and make results inaccurate. For figures that are relevant to multiple sectors, exactly where they go in the model will be a matter of personal preference. In such cases, as long as everything is properly documented, there is no right or wrong answer. 

It may be helpful to consider linked technologies together, as this will minimise interaction between sectors. For example, you could include one sector for heating and insulation, as they interact so much. 

## Keeping it simple  

The abiding principle when building a calculator is the model should be “as simple as possible, but no simpler” – you have to strike a balance between making sure it is easy to understand yet still analytically robust. 

If you can simplify the way in which you model a sector without compromising accuracy too much, do. The overall figures, and the major driving forces in supply and demand behind them, are what you need to get right. Modelling the intricacies of each sector can end up making it more difficult for non-experts to understand what is going on. Understandably, experts may not like this approach initially, but it has been key to the calculator’s success.

## Building driver trees

Once you have divided the energy system into sectors, it is time to look at each sector in more detail and identify the major drivers behind them. This will help you identify what levers you can pull to change demand and supply. You can do this by drawing “driver trees”. These are simple diagrams that show the way in which supply and demand for energy relate to produce outputs – at the top of a driver tree should be the output the calculator is focusing on, like emissions or fuel use. 

Basically, driver trees are another way of displaying the data and calculations you will need in the model. If you get them right, building your model will be a lot easier. 

For example, below is a driver tree for international aviation in the UK:

## Choosing your levers 

Once you have a driver tree for each sector, you can quickly see how changes in supply or demand can affect your outputs. Now you must choose which factors you think are the major drivers of change in the sector, and therefore which levers you would like to have in the model. Each lever will allow users to make a choice about what happens in the future. 

You can have any number of levers, but somewhere between 25 and 40 is particularly effective. The exact number will depend on your target group and how much time you want them to spend (or how much time they are willing to spend) using the tool. It is unlikely that a decision maker will be able to spend more than 30 minutes on the model. Generally, the more levers you have, the higher the credibility of the model but the fewer people will be able to engage with it.

To choose your levers, you must ask yourself: 

- What has changed in the past? 
- What is likely to change over time if we do nothing? 
- What changes would have the biggest impact? 
- What affect could policy or innovation have? 
- Could we change people’s behaviour?

Generally, each sector should have between one and three levers. If there are a few sectors that you really want to focus on, then you could have more. However, remember the calculator’s audience. If you choose an obscure variable to change, will a policy maker or an interested member of the public be knowledgeable enough to understand what they are changing and what the different options are? Choosing variables that are relevant to people’s lives is much more effective.

For example, if you are looking at international aviation, you could consider the following questions:

- Will people fly more in the future?
- Will more people fly?
- Will planes become more efficient?   

When choosing levers, it might be better to use “number of flights per year” rather than “average distance flown per flight”, as people know how often they fly, but are rarely aware of how far they fly.

Sometimes it is best to combine related technologies or behaviours together into one lever to make the model easier to use. For example, you could use one lever for the deployment of all small-scale micro-generation, rather than separate levers for micro wind, solar and hydro. Or you can combine demand for lighting and appliances into one lever because they are usually covered by similar policies. 

## Choosing your outputs

The calculator can show many different impacts of the energy choices that are available. What outputs you choose to include or exclude will depend on what is most important for you. All the calculators built so far have looked at greenhouse gas emissions, and some have considered costs, energy security (imports and exports, energy mix, energy balancing) and air quality.  Water and biodiversity are also options which are being considered. 

## Finding data

Once you have driver trees for all the sectors, it should be clear what data you will require to populate your model. When building an open model like the calculator, the data you use must be either publically available already, or you must have permission to make it publically available. If you use anything confidential, you will not be able to publish the model. You must always keep this in mind when deciding what figures to use.

Data sources will vary from country to country and region to region. Government statistical departments are a great place to start, but it could be that universities or other research organisations may also have useful data. The government may already have some models containing data, which you could use. Where official data is not routinely collected or easily available, international bodies like the International Energy Agency (IEA) may be able to help. 

Not all the data you will need is country specific. The laws of physics are universal, so you will be able to use many of the same assumptions and figures as previously completed calculators. For example, the efficiencies of solar PV panels will be similar around the world so the assumption can be used from an existing calculator. However, solar irradiance levels will vary depending on your geographical location. 

Sometimes it can be very difficult to get the data you need – perhaps you have split sectors up differently from the data sources so you cannot get the data to match, or the information just isn’t collected in your country. In these cases, it is very important that you do not compromise the logic of the model to fit the data. Instead, bend the data to suit the model. Use proxies, estimates and international precedents. Just make sure you document all these assumptions so users can see what you are doing and assess its suitability.
