The 2050 Calculator Book
===============

This is a guide to implementing your own 2050 calculator. You can read it at http://book.2050.org.uk.

It is written as a series of markdown files. These are then turned into a pdf, website and an e-book by using the programs in the public folder.

# Writing markdown

The files are written in the [pandoc variant](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html#pandocs-markdown) of markdown. 

# Adding a section

If you want to add a section, create a new file with the text and then add it in the right position in the [contents.txt](./contents.txt) file.

# Adding images

Images can't be added through the online interface (yet).
