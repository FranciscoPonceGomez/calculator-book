You'll have published data then modelled dataIf it's wrong, maybe load factor is wrong. Or it could be that a power station was being shut down for x weeks.

"We capture the total emissions per km2 of land farmed in the Òsoil managementÓ assumptions in sheet VI.a. We do not look at choices on specific fertilizer.The change in emissions from soil management reflects changes through continued improvement in nutrient management practices on farms (declines are limited by an increase in bioenergy crop land in the scenarios where this occurs). Details from the Pathways analysis report:- Compared to other sectors of the economy there is much greater scientific uncertainty in estimating emissions from agriculture and land use and predicting the effects of changing practices and drivers. For example, the amount of N2O released from spreading fertiliser can depend on soil type, the weather, and when and how the spreading was done. The Government is working with the research community to improve the UKÕs inventory of GHGs within the agriculture and land use sector so that our future policies are guided by the best evidence available and so farmers and land managers are properly credited for improvements in farming practice.- The dominant source of agricultural N2O emissions is the breakdown of fertilisers and manures applied to the soils (33%), with significant contributions from indirect sources, notably from leaching and runoff (26%). Significant reductions to agricultural N2O emissions have been achieved since 1990,196 largely through more efficient use of fertilisers and reduced application to grasslands. The current methodology employed to estimate emissions of N2O from soil in the UK inventory is imprecise Ð soil characteristics, land use and fertiliser type are not currently differentiated and calculations are based on total tonnes of nitrogen applied. There is therefore much uncertainty around soil emissions. Approximate assumptions have been made within the trajectories for this section, but this remains an area where further work is needed to improve the analysis.- Note - UK manufacture of fertilisers is included within industry (in the Chemicals and petrochemicals sector)."

In particular, you will notice that subtotals are calculated for certain fuel types and used by the heat supply (XVII.a), power generation (II.a, I.b, I.a), electricity distribution (VII.b), and biomass (V.a and V.b) sectors, a subtotal is computed. This subtotal is the total energy flow, of a particular fuel type, from a subset of the sectors. (There is a similar calculation done for XVI.b, balancing imports, which really should have been done in its own sectoral worksheet).What is going on turns out to be straightforward, although it certainly doesn't appear so at first glance. The job of certain sectors is to supply (or demand) an amount of energy that is not fixed by the assumptions, but depends upon what is demanded by the rest of the model. For example, electricity from gas generation is produced in whatever quantity is required to meet the total demand for electricity. So somehow the amount of electricity demanded needs to be passed to that sector.

Biomass is produced in the spreadsheet as a result of a combination of user choices across a number of sectors.The user specifies the amount of domestically produced biomass and how they want this to be converted into different forms (a mix of gaseous, liquid and solid).This is combined with imported biomass to provide the total available biomass. (i.e.. the quantity of bio used in the system is calculated at an aggregate level, rather than at a sector level, and the implications for emission are calculated, via the bio-energy credit section of the years sheets.)This total biomass is then used up by the sectors that use the corresponding end use forms of fuel. When the user selects options that need a solid fuel in the Calculator, the fuels available are used up in a particular order, as follows: domestic biomass and imported biomass; then domestic coal; and finally imported coal. If a preferential fuel type is not available then the Calculator uses the next type. The same order of preference is assumed for oil and liquid biomass and for natural gas and gaseous biomass, where biomass is used ahead of fossil fuel sources when it is available. The India Calculator has a more detailed approach, which, for example, allows the quantity of fuel wood used for domestic cooking to be identified."	Green			GH done	Bioenergy	122	How would we account for wood used for heating/cooking?

The UK has a big coastline, so there was a lobby asking to include it in our model so that we can judge the effect in comparison to other options.ItÕs another example where the team had to take political criteria into account, and include something that is significant to some key audiences of the tools even though the impact may be small or uncertain.Marine algae seem unlikely to offer a realistic source of energy, though some small scale PBRs are in existence for production of high value products. Micro-algae yields can be improved through the addition of CO2 or nutrients, for example from power stations, factories or waste water treatment plants.Due to the generally perceived lack of suitability of conditions in the UK for producing micro-algae on a scale required to make a significant contribution to energy supply, the UK calculator focuses on the production of macro-algae.

Research literature indicates that although gasification has yet to be demonstrated at a large-scale level, there are already a series of successful small-scale demonstration projects taking place. An NNFCC roadmap looking at the technology suggests that entrained flow gasification plants capable of processing up to 3,000 tonnes of biomass per day could be online before 2015.

The Calculator does allow for the possibility of biogas in the model (indeed, it is possible to focus biomass conversion on to gas), but the treatment of it is slightly unclear. Once biomass has been converted to a usable form of energy in the Calculator, whether solid, liquid or gas, it is considered to be directly substitutable for fossil fuel hydrocarbons.

"Consumer electronics and home computing present the biggest challenges to reducing energy demand in the domestic sector.

For example, televisions account for the largest share of the energy used by consumer electronics, and their number in households is expected to rise by 21% between 2010 and 2020. However, technological developments, such as new display technologies, reducing standby consumption and reducing on-powerconsumption, could curb increases in demand for electricity for these products.New backlighting technologies and variable brightness control could double the efficiency of liquid crystal display (LCD) televisions. Likewise, the efficiency of plasma technology for plasma televisions is expected to double over the next few years. Some products, such as computer monitors and televisions, consume electric power while they are left on standby or even when they are switched off and plugged in. For some products this power enables useful features such as responsiveness to remote control, but in other products it does not offer any such advantages.

"The use of more efficient products could have an effect on other energy uses. Inefficient lights, computing equipment and poorly insulated ovens, for example, emit heat, which consequently warms our homes and buildings. Sometimes this heat is useful to maintain a comfortable indoor temperature. At other times the additional heat is not necessary and we use other technologies (such as air-conditioners) to bring the temperature back to comfortable levels.As the efficiency of products improves, the amount of heat generated by lights and appliances will drop. When this heat is not useful to maintain comfortable temperatures, improving the efficiency of lights and appliances will have the additional benefit of there being less need for energy for cooling.

There is a significant fraction of the population who do not take up measures regardless of how cost effective they are (estimated at 28% of the owner-occupier population).People can be put off by the disruption associated with some measures, for example floor insulation and internal solid wall insulation. In the case of internal solid wall insulation there can also be a significant loss of floor area. The savings achieved by energy efficiency improvements can also be reduced by Ôcomfort takingÕ, in which the measures partly support warmer internal temperatures rather than increased energy savings."	Amber	PAR			Ruth question ideaBuildings	151	What types of electric heating technologies are modelled?	"The following electric heating technologies have been examined:¥ resistive heating;¥ ground source heat pumps; and¥ air source heat pumps."	Amber	PAR	Still up to date?	GH	Ruth question ideaBuildings	152	How do heat pumps work?	"The 2050 project divides heat pumps into air source heat pumps (ASHPs) and ground source heat pumps (GSHPs). Heat pumps can be used with either wet heating systems (for example, radiators) or dry heating systems (for example, forced air blowers). Heat pump efficiency is usually stated in terms of a Coefficient of Performance (ÔCoPÕ), which is the ratio of useful heat output to electrical input.The second law of thermodynamics limits the maximum CoP that can be achieved by a heat pump. The maximum CoP is dependent on the temperature difference between the cold body and the hot body. For building heating applications, this means that the CoP of the heat pump is reduced if the external temperature (of the ground sub-surface or air) is lower, or if a higher temperature needs to be achieved (for example, to heat hot water). The variation of heat pump CoP with temperature has a number of implications if heat pumps are to be used for building heating applications.The rate of heat delivery required to maintain an adequately high internal temperature is dependent on the rate of heat loss from the building, which is in turn dependent on its levels of insulation and air-tightness. The first trade-off is therefore between insulation levels and the rate of heat delivery required. Although this is true for all heating systems, for heat pumps the variation in efficiency with delivered temperature makes this trade-off particularly acute._ Better insulating buildings enables heat pumps with a smaller power rating to be used. This is beneficial, as the size and cost of a heat pump increase as the rated power increases. If buildings are well insulated then existing radiator systems could operate at lower temperatures and still meet the demand, which would improve CoPs._ The noise generated by ASHPs also increases as the rated power increases (for the same size of air to refrigerant heat exchanger). Quiet ASHPs are less likely to be constrained in their deployment, particularly in higher density areas where buildings are in close proximity to each other and there is a greater potential for cumulative noise to become a problem. Future technology improvement may reduce the noise associated with ASHPs._ Should electric heating achieve a high penetration in UK households, the smaller peaks in space heating demand associated with better insulated dwellings would help reduce the capacity of the electricity infrastructure required to meet peak heat demand, for example upgrades to local sub-stations and networks.Possible constraints on the uptake of air-to-air systems include fan noise in quiet rooms (such as bedrooms) and different perceptions of thermal comfort compared to radiator systems."	Amber	PAR	Still up to date?

The consequences of not electrifying sectors and therefore not increasing electricity generation would be large requirements for bioenergy and heroic levels of behaviour change to reduce per capita energy consumption.Therefore, although it is physically possible to reduce electricity generation and reach the UK's 2050 target, it involves a large amount of heroic effort on demand and bioenergy that many stakeholders consider unrealistic. An increase in electricity generation has been one common message of the pathways analysis to date, and indeed work from the CCC and economic models, such as MARKAL, indicate a similar trend. As the department works towards producing a narrower set of plausible pathways, then we could begin answer with more certainty, but until then it remains true to say that the 2050 work indicates a need for an increase in electricity generation in the majority of pathways presented, with many pathways more than doubling current generation demand."

"There are 130 technologies in the 2050 Calculator and capital, operating expenditure and fuel cost estimates are included for each of these to 2050.  These cost estimates cover the whole of the energy system (everything from: power stations and industrial processes; to cars, planes and trains and the fuel they use; to gas boilers and cavity wall insulation). On the energy supply side, this includes power stations, primary energy sources (fossil fuels, uranium and biomass) and transmission networks. On the energy demand side, this includes energy users (heating systems, cars and industrial plants) and demand reducing equipment such as insulation.The 2050 Costs Calculator has the following cost information for each technology and fuel in 2050:¥ Low cost estimate Ð costs are the lowest that credible published studies suggest they could be by 2050, for example assuming technology breakthroughs and low cost material and labour.¥ High cost estimate Ð costs in 2050 are frozen at todayÕs levels (or even higher if credible published evidence suggests this could be the case).  This assumes no technological breakthroughs over the next forty years and high labour and material costs.¥ Within this low / high costs range a default point estimate Ð consistent with MARKAL."	Amber	Cost methodology		GH	Ruth made upCost	179	Where does the cost data come from?	"The cost estimates in the 2050 Costs Calculator are drawn from a wide range of credible, published sources.  Sources include economic and energy models (in particular MARKAL), sectoral analysis (Parsons Brinckerhoff, Mott MacDonald, AEA, NERA), UK Government Departments, independent analytical bodies such as the Committee on Climate Change and wherever possible the real world cost of technologies as reported by financial bodies or the media. The 2050 Calculator includes no new evidence about costs, it simply brings together existing published assumptions. For full details of the costs methodology, see: http://2050-calculator-tool-wiki.decc.gov.uk/pages/28 "	Amber	Cost methodology			Ruth made upCost	180	What caveats should I use when presenting cost data?	"There are certain costs associated with the move to a low carbon economy, which this analysis does not capture (such as wider macroeconomic impacts and the inconvenience from living in cooler buildings). And, critically, this analysis does not take into account any of the benefits associated with the move to a low carbon economy.  These include:-1. The avoided devastating damages of climate change Ð the Stern Review estimated this environmental cost at up to 20% of GDP per year globally, a figure that helps contextualise the cost of mitigating climate change, which he estimated to be 1-2% of GDP globally. 2. The benefits of greater energy security.  If the UK did nothing to tackle climate change, the proportion of our energy we get from imported fossil fuels will rise from around 23% in 2007 to 53% in 2020 and 88% in 2050, meaning that our spending on net imported fossil fuels would rise from around £10bn today to £32bn in 2020 to £86bn in 2050. This would leave the UK more vulnerable to fossil fuel shortages and price spikes.  However, if we meet our 80% target, then by 2050 imported fossil fuels could account for only 7-30% of our energy, at a cost of £8-24bn.3. Investment in the green economy is a strong driver of economic growth and jobs.  The global low carbon market is projected to reach £4 trillion by 2015 as economies around the world invest in low carbon technologies.  Investment in renewables, globally, already outstripping investment in fossil fuels.  By 2015, over 1 million people in the UK are expected to be employed in the green economy. 4. Another important caveat to the analysis is that the costs the combination of technologies chosen by the user and does not take into account price interactions between supply and demand. This link gives more information: http://2050-calculator-tool-wiki.decc.gov.uk/pages/82"	Amber	Cost methodology			Ruth made upCost	181	How can we know what costs will be in the future?	"Future fuel and technology costs are highly uncertain. The following are just a few factors which could cause future technology costs to be lower or higher:¥ The climate change policy of other countries. Lots of long term, predictable climate initiatives internationally could have a big effect on RDD&D expenditure globally which could bring down technology costs.¥ Success of scientists and engineers in discovering better, cheaper low carbon technology solutions.¥ Technology roll out in other countries. This could push prices up (e.g. if it results in a shortage of, say, CCS engineers), or push prices down (if learning by doing reduces unit costs). The UK is not a very large market and so could be a price taker for many technologies.¥ Technology roll out in the UK. For example, the marginal cost of land used for wind turbines will increase as the roll out of wind increases. Alternatively, marginal cost of installing charging points for electric vehicles may decline as the number of electric vehicles in circulation increases through learning by doing / economies of scale.The 2050 calculator's cost range is a simple way of attempting to capture all the above factors. The cost range for 2050 represents the highest / lowest that credible experts can foresee costs being. Specifically:¥ Low cost estimate Ð costs are the lowest that credible published studies suggest they could be by 2050, for example assuming technology breakthroughs and low cost material and labour.¥ High cost estimate Ð costs in 2050 are frozen at todayÕs levels (or even higher if credible published evidence suggests this could be the case). This assumes no technological breakthroughs over the next forty years and high labour and material costs.There are three advantages to this simple methodology for defining high/low costs:¥ Simple Ð this is analytically simple and easy to understand. It is objective because technology costs today are a verifiable fact.¥ Avoids false confidence Ð there is genuine uncertainty about whether scientists will achieve the technology breakthroughs necessary to bring down the costs of specific technologies. We should not presume that the cost of any technology will fall as a matter of course e.g. history shows that nuclear power costs have actually risen over the last forty years.¥ Consistent with 2050 Calculator trajectory methodology Ð the technology trajectories reflect all credible views on the role of technologies. Similarly, our high/low range reflects all credible views on possible future costs."	Amber	Cost methodology			Ruth made upCost	182	Do costs for a technology become cheaper if it becomes more commonly used? (i.e.. learning rates)	"No. The high/low costs we use for each technology will be the same regardless of which pathway the user selects. In other words, costs are treated as exogenous to the model, not endogenous.We have done this for two reasons:1. To keep the simplicity of the Calculator. If we made the Calculator capable of modelling learning rates then it would be a less transparent, simple and accessible tool. 2. The UK is likely to be a price taker in many technologies. It would arguably be spurious accuracy because levels of technology R&D and roll out in other countries will arguably have more of an impact on the UK than our own choices (i.e. the UK is a price taker). Although costs are exogenous, we do make a provision for minimal technological improvement over time. For most technologies, we assume incremental improvements in energy efficiency over time. So although the high, low cost estimates appear constant over time, on a like for like comparison prices are actually falling slightly."	Amber	Cost methodology			Ruth made upCost	183	What type of cost questions can be answered by the calculator?	"The 2050 Calculator should be used to answer questions such as:¥ What are the capital, operating and fuel costs of pathway X relative to pathway Y?¥ What are the biggest component costs of pathway X?¥ How might the capital, operating and fuel costs of pathway X change when, say, renewables costs are as cheap as credible experts believe possible, and nuclear costs are expensive?But it should not be used to answer questions such as:¥ What is the effect on energy demand of, say, switching to more expensive forms of electricity generation? (Because the 2050 Calculator does not have a price feedback.)¥ What is the impact of policy X on energy bills? (Because the 2050 Calculator cannot say what the impact on an electricity or heating bill will be - this is mostly because we would need to make an assumption about the policy used to implement this change.)¥ What is the expected cost of policy X over the next 10-20 years? (The Calculator is best suited to 2050 analysis, not short/medium term analysis.)¥ What are the wider macroeconomic costs or welfare costs of policy X? (These impacts are excluded from the Calculator.)¥ WhatÕs the optimal, least cost means of reducing emissions by 80%? (The Calculator cannot automatically work this out but the user can work out least cost pathways for themselves.)"	Amber	Cost methodology			Ruth made upCost	36	How can one see the costs sections of the analysis on the webtool	"The costs part of the analysis can be found by clicking on the ""see implications"" button in the top left corner of the webtool window.

The 2050 Calculator is intended to be a simple model; it does not model the markets and relationships which would be needed to work out this level of detail. Furthermore, the Calculator is designed to be policy neutral. The model does not inform on how pathways might be achieved, only the potential for what could be achieved. For this reason, it is more consistent to calculate costs at the broadest level."	Green	wiki			wiki: http://2050-calculator-tool-wiki.decc.gov.uk/pages/115?redirect_from=FAQCost	61	Why are the cost ranges so large?	"Our initial approach has been to create a large cost range, encompassing all credible experts opinions and forecasts of costs over time. At this stage we have not attempted to add probability distributions to future costs, since we do not believe there is sufficient data or evidence in most cases to achieve this.We wish to capture all credible experts views on costs, however if there are some cost estimates used which are widely discredited, please comment on those sources and add other cost sources.

"The period between 2010 and 2050 is broken down into nine five year periods in the Calculator. We use one cost for each of these periods. This cost is generally calculated by linearly interpolating between the 2010 and 2050 figures - that is to say for the middle period, 2030 to 2035, the cost will be half way be between the 2010 and 2050 costs; for the fifth period the cost is five ninths of the way between the 2010 and the 2050 costs. In the case of the power sector we have followed the way the costs fall in the MARKAL model. The costs do not change in every period from this source, with typically three or so ""vintages"" of costs. For example one cost for the 2020s, another for the 2030s and then a third for the period after 2045. The actual numbers for the costs and the calculations involved can be found in the excel spreadsheet version of the model, although the 2010 and 2050 costs displayed on the wiki give a good approximation of the trend."

"					Emissions	126	Why are some emissions negative?	" In the emissions chart in the ÒControlÓ worksheet, you will see that some emissions are negative. The technologies that have particular characteristics that result in negative emissions are as follows: ¥ Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Ð when gas is burned in a CCS power station, the Calculator applies the natural gas emissions factor to the quantity burned and adds the resulting CO2 to the modelÕs total emissions. To account for the fact that these emissions are captured, an equivalent negative quantity of emissions is also added to the total. ¥ Biomass Ð like all other fuels, when biofuelsÕ biomass are combusted, the model applies an emissions factor according to its physical state. However, unlike hydrocarbons, biofuels do not produce any CO2 when burned. UNFCCC accounting guidelines state that countries should treat biomass as an emissions neutral energy source. This is because carbon from the atmosphere is sequestered into the biomass while the feedstock is growing. To account for this, an equivalent negative quantity of emissions is included in the emission calculation. When biofuels are combined with CSS, the above treatments combine, resulting in a negative contribution to the overall CO2 emission calculation. ¥ Geosequestration - these technologies remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere and store it in parts of the geochemical system. The amount of CO2 removed appears as a negative quantity in the emissions calculation.

"I believe that, for CO_2, we used the specific emissions factor for the particular fuel listed in the table. (Eg, for solids, we used the emissions factor for industrial coal). These emissions factors are reported in DUKES (the Digest of UK Energy Statistics, published by DECC). It turns out that emissions factors expressed as emissions per unit of energy (rather than per unit of mass or volume) are reasonably constant for all hydrocarbon fuels of a particular physical state Ð certainly within the limits of uncertainty expected of a model like this.For the other gases, CH_4 and N_2O, we used the ratio of these gases emitted to CO_2 emitted from combustion (of the appropriate fuel) for the total UK emissions, as reported in the Greenhouse Gas Inventory, and assumed this ratio applied to all sources. In summary: for each physical state of hydrocarbons, we first estimated CO_2 emission as above, then applied a constant multiplier to obtain the emissions of the other gasses."	Green	wiki		GH done	wiki: http://2050-calculator-tool-wiki.decc.gov.uk/pages/115?redirect_from=FAQFossil fuels	121	There are lots of types of coal - which type are you comparing to?	"In the UKÕs 2050 calculator, there are only 3 emissions factors: solid, liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons.The emissions factor work on a Ôper unit of energyÕ basis, which means that all fuels of same physical state have same emissions. These wouldn't be the same on mass, but on a TWh basis, works the same.Because this is done on an energy basis, we can use same emissions factor on all hydrocarbons.  This is a very small simplification, applied generally, which keeps things a lot more manageableSo each type of hydrocarbons goes to the end use, and is not allocated to specific sectors.

Although there are inevitably uncertainties about predicting costs of anything decades in the future, we felt that in order to have an honest and fair discussion about the UKÕs energy future we needed to reflect the potential costs.Since then the 2050 Pathways team have received comments about how shale gas is treated within the 2050 Pathways Calculator, with some people expressing concern that we were ignoring this source of energy.Shale gas is a natural gas (predominantly methane) found in shale rock. Natural gas produced from shale is often referred to as ÔunconventionalÕ and this refers to the type of rock in which it is found. ÔConventionalÕ oil and gas refers to hydrocarbons which have previously been in sandstone or limestone, instead of shale or coal which are now the focus of unconventional exploration.The 2050 Pathways Calculator does not distinguish whether natural gas in the pathways originates from ÔconventionalÕ or ÔunconventionalÕ sources. It takes natural gas as a primary energy source.If the Calculator user believes that shale gas will significantly lower the price of natural gas in the UK in the future, he/she can choose lower cost assumptions in the Calculator section Ôcosts sensitivityÕ. Users could look at the impact of gas being 45p/therm to 100p/therm in 2050. These high/low gas prices are taken from the DECC fossil fuel price projections published in October 2011.The Calculator has no constraints on the amount of gas the UK can use. For example, in the Òdo not tackle climate changeÓ scenario (defined as all level 1s), 66% of energy supply in 2050 is natural gas. The Calculator just assumes that gas imports are available."

"	"The Calculator takes a simple approach where total energy demand and supply within the UK are calculated separately, and any difference between them is balanced with imports/exports. There is no attempt to show the path from extraction, to conversion and then consumption within specific sectors.In the case of liquid hydrocarbons, as were the focus of your question, the total requirement is calculated in row 101, ÔSubtotal.XVI.a Requested hydrocarbonsÕ (e.g. 830.4 TWh in 2010) of vector V.04.This demand is met with domestic production via sector XV.b, (802.5 TWh) , with the remainder (27.9 TWh) being supplied via balancing imports in vector Y.05. These quantities enter via vector C.02, and are transferred to vector V.04 via the Ôfossil fuel transfersÕ sector (XVI.a), so that supply and demand for sector V.04 net to zero.Sector XV.a is essentially a subsidiary sector that exists primarily to calculate the costs, energy requirements and emissions associated with refining the domestically produced fossil fuels. The energy inputs and outputs of have already accounted for as described above.To maintain simplicity, the Calculator treats all liquid hydrocarbons the same, whether they are diesel or petrol etc. The fact that the emissions factors for these different fuel types are, on an energy basis (i.e. MtCO2/TWh), essentially the same, enables this simplified approach to work.

Why is this done?	"The ÒUK Primary Energy SupplyÓ chart in the 2050 Calculator Webtool shows the energy supplied from the available primary energy sources in the Calculator: the ÒcoalÓ line shows the energy derived from coal; the ÒbioenergyÓ line shows energy derived from biomass. However, choices on solid biomass have an impact on coal use and this will be visible in the chart. This is because energy demand is always met in the 2050 Calculator, and if insufficient biomass is provided the corresponding fossil fuel is used. For example, if the user selects a higher level of biomass power plant deployment, then coal use will increase if there is insufficient solid biomass in the userÕs pathway to satisfy the solid hydrocarbon demand.A detailed breakdown of the energy supplied from the different sources is provided in the spreadsheet in the ÒIntermediate outputÓ worksheet, rows 23 to 47.

For example, within transport the Chinese calculator team have made a few big changes. TheyÕve divide transport into urban and rural to reflect the very different patterns of travel, and the shorter distances travelled.In your transport sector, youÕll also need to think about what you want to include and how you want to split it.

"VLOOKUP formulae are useful, but for a large spreadsheet they are slow, and more likely to cause errors if columns are moved or deleted. For this reason, the Calculator uses the much quicker and more reliable combination of Index and match formula. By using index and match together in Excel, you can match a cell based on 3 criteria, but it's complex which is why formulae can seem complicated and fiddly at first. However there are only a few variations of the formulae that you will need to understand.You can read how this works at the following link: http://book.2050.org.uk/calculator-book/index.htmlBut in brief, ÔIndex and MatchÕ formulae combine two Excel worksheet functions (ÔIndexÕ and ÔMatchÕ) to provide a flexible way of performing a ÔlookupÕ. The ÔIndexÕ function returns a specific value from a specified array, according to the row and column numbers stipulated in the formulae. The ÔMatchÕ function returns the relative position of a given value within a specified array.The ÔMatchÕ function can be used in place of either the column or row reference (or both) within the ÔIndexÕ function. This enables the return of a value within an array by referring to a particular value in the column or row heading (rather than referring to a the row number or column number). Within the Calculator, index and match formulae are largely used in conjunction with other functions, as shown in the example immediately below, where the approach is used together with structured table references."

"These vectors (both primary and secondary) aim to be mutually exclusive and comprehensive of the whole energy system (i.e. collectively exhaustive, so that in combination they cover the whole energy system). It would be ok to change definitions to better fit Colombian statistical conventions, but you would need to be very careful that you were not going to double count anything (e.g. make sure everything is mutually exclusive).You would need to add any additional primary or secondary sources as vectors in the technology sheets, and then also add these to the year sheets.

"No, the 2050 Calculator is a user driven model. The user specifies energy supply and demand across the economy by selecting effort levels for around 40 sectors. In this respect, the Calculator is fundamentally different from cost optimisation models such as MARKAL. Models such as MARKAL examine the costs of different technologies and work out the least cost pathway to achieving an emissions reduction target.It is possible to identify low cost pathways using the Calculator, but the user has to do this manually through an iterative process. An example of a very low cost pathway is the Analogous to MARKAL pathway (http://2050-calculator-tool-wiki.decc.gov.uk/pages/170 describes a representation of a least cost pathway from MARKAL).However, if you wish to use the 2050 calculator as an optimisation model, you can.

"Transmission: The UK 2050 Calculator assumes that there is one national electricity grid that can connect to all electricity generation technologies (e.g. micro-wind to nuclear power). It also assumes that all electricity consumers within the economy have access to this grid. To give an extreme example Ð if offshore wind is built in a potentially remote area (e.g. far off the Scottish coast) the Calculator assumes that this electricity will just go into the general pool of electricity generation, to be consumed by the overall total demand for electricity (i.e. it does not assume that this electricity will be consumed by a particular actor or in a particular geographic area). This is a modelling simplification that was deemed reasonable given that the 2050 Calculator looks to provide a simple, but credible, macro-view of the UK."

"The adoption of fuel cell technology in vehicles in the 2050 Calculator is determined by the user of the Calculator as follows: 1.The user selects the absolute number of motor vehicles that will be driven up to 2050, using the Òdomestic transport behaviourÓ lever; 2.The user selects the proportion of vehicles they want to be electrified up to 2050, using the Òshift to zero emission transportÓ lever; and 3.The user selects the technology they want electrified motor vehicles to adopt (hydrogen fuel cells or battery electric) in the Òchoice of car and van technologyÓ lever. The 2050 Calculator then ÒproducesÓ enough hydrogen to provide the hydrogen demanded by hydrogen fuels cell vehicles (specified by the user in steps i to iii). This production requires gas and electricity in proportions that vary over time: 1.Hydrogen is produced either by Òsteam methane reformingÓ (SMR) using gaseous hydrocarbons or Òdistributed water electrolysisÓ (DWE) using electricity; and 2.the Calculator assumes that over time hydrogen will increasingly be produced by DWE, and so produced using electricity rather than gas (it is assumed that by 2050 100% of hydrogen will be produced by DWE). "	Green	wiki			wiki: http://2050-calculator-tool-wiki.decc.gov.uk/pages/115?redirect_from=FAQUnits	85	"Under the individual Supply sheets, the ""Fixed assumptions"" section also has an ""Implications"" subsection (e.g. rows 70-71 in II.a (Nuclear), or 53-54 under III.a.2 (Onshore wind)).We notice that units there are somewhat misleading, sometimes quoting capacity and then giving actually energy values instead of power.

"The Conversions sheet is designed so that this should be very easy to do, and this summary should help you understand how the units work. (Also see question 90):http://book.2050.org.uk/calculator-book/appendix-4-units.htmlThe easiest way to add a new currency unit is to follow these steps:- Go to the Conversions sheet and scroll down to the title 'Cost conversions' which lists all currencies.- We recommend keeping all the existing rows there (as someone may still want to use UK or other currencies), so the first stage is to copy an existing row to create a duplicate.- Decide the name you want to use for your currency, and type this name into column D. We recommend using the standard prefixes (k for 1,000, then M for 1 million, G for 1 billion and T for 1,000 billion)- In column E, set the named range to be the same as the name you typed in column D.- Enter the conversion rate in column F. For the UK version, we have hardcoded this column as the £ conversion value (i.e.. the value for £1 is 1, and all other values are proportional to this). You could easily choose another currency (e.g. $) here, but you just need to make sure your conversions are correct.- The formula in column E should automatically be correct if you copied it from another row - this will adjust all numbers to be in your preferred currency (as set in the Preferences sheet).- Test your currency is working by typing = [your named currency range] into a blank cell, and making sure this gives the expected value in the preferred currency.
