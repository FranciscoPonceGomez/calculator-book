# Introduction 

Energy is essential to civilisation. In many countries the way we get and the use energy has to change: either because more energy is needed to develop; or the current approach to energy is insecure, expensive, unpopular or polluting.

Much of the infrastructure that uses, supplies and transmits the energy we use has a very long life, therefore we need to think long-term when we decide what to do about it.

Many sources of energy are unpopular: they are expensive, they cause pollution, they are considered unsafe, they are unsightly, they are a hastle to use. Many ways that energy might be used or conserved are also unpopular for similar reasons. Trade-offs between these different consequences have to be made.

The 2050 Calculator approach to energy and emissions modelling is about understanding how a group of people – whether at the regional, country or even global level – use energy, and then identifying the real changes that could be made to supply and demand. Discussions with experts help to prioritise a small number of simple choices (or levers) which are then translated into an interactive tool to allow people to explore all the different options. The impact of people’s choices on emissions, land use, air quality and energy security can be displayed instantly. A calculator gives people a platform to have more informed conversations, and those in power the information to make better decisions. 

This book will take you through the process of building a calculator step by step based on the experiences of teams around the world who have already built their own. Compared to most energy models, a calculator is relatively simple to build, use and understand, but each city, region or country will have its own specific challenges. We therefore cannot hope to answer every question you may have in this book. This is why we also developing an online community, so that people can share their experience and expertise. 

## Who is this book for? 

This book is aimed primarily at people thinking of building a calculator, but is also for anyone wanting to explore whether a calculator may be of use to them, or for those that are just interested in the approach – this could be policy makers and analysts working in government, but equally those working in industry or academia.

## What does this book contain?


## A brief history of the calculator 

The calculator story began in the UK in 2009, when the government’s Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) was tasked with coming up with a plan to meet the world’s first legally binding emissions target (an 80% reduction based on a 1990 baseline by 2050, as laid out in the Climate Change Act 2008).  

The traditional approach to such a policy problem is to use economic modelling techniques to set the strategy by finding the optimum cost-efficient pathway, and then develop policies to bring this change about. In this case, coming up with a single pathway for the country just didn’t seem appropriate. Firstly, the issue was so multi-faceted; any transition to a low-carbon economy would affect not just the type of power stations that will be built, but also the decisions people make in their daily lives, like how to travel to work or how to heat their homes. There was also a lot of uncertainty about what technologies would be available or affordable 30 or 40 years into the future. Taking bets now on which technologies will win is too risky when you are dealing with public money.

At the same time, Professor David MacKay at the University of Cambridge published the book _Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air_ (available for free at [www.withouthotair.com](http://www.withouthotair.com)), which explores the technical and practical limits of all low-carbon technologies and how this compares to the amount of energy we currently use. This provided inspiration for the team – an interactive version of the book would allow policy makers to explore what is possible for the UK using real scientific evidence. Instead of providing a definitive answer, it would make the debate more informed.  

The first version of the calculator was released in July 2010 as a work in progress with a call for evidence (a consultation asking experts for feedback) to help improve it. A conscious decision was made to be as open and transparent as possible, so the full model and all its assumptions were published at the same time for everyone to see. Instead of releasing an approved government pathway, a number of “key messages” from the calculator were published – lessons learnt from all pathways that meet the 2050 target. These were then used to develop 2011’s Carbon Plan, the government’s overall emission reduction strategy, which included a number of example pathways created using the calculator.  

DECC was approached by an organisation called ScienceWise-ERC, which promotes public dialogue in policy making. They wanted to build a simplified version of the calculator aimed at the general public, particularly children and young people, to help spark a debate on energy and climate change. This became the My2050 game (which you can play at [http://my2050.decc.gov.uk](http://my2050.decc.gov.uk)). Over 17,000 people have submitted a pathway using this tool so far, giving a unique insight into public opinion on the issue. 

An unintended (but very welcome) side-effect of being open and transparent was that analysts in other countries heard about the calculator and decided to make their own. The first was the region of Wallonia in Belgium, closely followed by China. Now over 10 more countries have either completed their calculator, or are in the process of building one. DECC won funding from the UK’s International Climate Fund to support this work in developing countries. 

The calculator approach has truly gone global, but there are many more cities, regions, or countries out there who could benefit.

## What is a calculator?

The 2050 Calculator is an open source model of energy and emissions that can be used to identify a range of physically possible scenarios for the future. This could be with the aim of reducing emissions to tackle climate change, improving air quality, or reducing dependence on fuel imports. Most calculators built so far have used the year 2050 as the end point, but in theory any year could be chosen (for example, India used 2047 as it is the 100th anniversary of their independence). Almost all of them have covered a single country each, as that is level that decisions tend to be made, but there is no reason why cities or regions can’t have their own calculators. A calculator can answer questions like:

- How much energy can we supply from different technologies?
- How much energy do different sectors use and how can we change this?
- What is the cost of different energy pathways? 
- Which sectors are the ones we should focus on? Which are less important?
- How can we achieve our emissions targets? 
- What impact would different pathways have on our air quality and land area?
- What could happen to our energy dependency and security?
- What technology options are publically acceptable?

Users control the calculator by making choices using a number of “levers” (usually between 30 and 50). These levers make a change in either the supply or demand of energy in a particular sector, for example building nuclear power stations, or reducing the distance people travel by car. You can also include changes to energy infrastructure like adding electricity storage, or technologies like geosequestration, which don’t quite fit under demand or supply. The combination of these choices creates a “pathway”, and the calculator then displays the implications of the pathway over time (for example in terms of energy demand, emissions, land use or air quality).

For each lever you have a number of options to choose from – most will have four possible “levels” labelled 1, 2, 3 and 4. These relate to the amount of effort being used, ranging from doing nothing to putting in the maximum amount of effort or going to the limit of technical feasibility. This allows the user to see the range of opinion from experts as to what is possible in the future. If there is a choice between different options with similar levels of effort or where the concept of “effort” doesn’t really apply, then the levels can be labelled A, B, C and D rather than 1, 2, 3 and 4 (for example the choice between plug-in electric or hydrogen vehicles, or different economic growth scenarios for a country).     

The UK’s calculator comes in three different versions aimed at different audiences. Other countries have tended to adopt a similar approach:

- The full model, built in Excel 2007, which contains all the calculations and assumptions. This allows expert users to examine pathways in more detail or to change assumptions or data to suit their needs. 
- The web tool, an interactive and user-friendly web interface that allows users to explore all the options in an easy way. This is aimed at policy makers and stakeholders, but is also suitable for members of the public who are very interested in the subject.
- My2050, a simplified, game-style version that is aimed at the general public. Users can make fewer choices, but it provides an overview of the main issues and trade-offs

The calculator is an extremely accessible, open and transparent model. It is open in three ways:

1. The basic model is built using Excel, which is widely used all over the world, and the software for the web tool is open source. This makes it much easier for people to use and even to develop their own versions. 
1. The full model has been published online and is fully documented so that anyone with an interest can explore how it works and comment on it if they disagree with anything. Calculators work best if they are produced in this way; by publishing the full model and actively asking for feedback, stakeholders and experts can help improve it. 
1. The model’s functionality itself is more accessible and open than most energy models, allowing people to play around and try out new ideas rather than the model itself working out a “right” answer. 

## What makes the calculator different? 

Some models only include the power sector, or do not include process emissions from industry or from land use. The calculator covers all energy forms (oil, coal, gas, biomass, electricity etc.) and all emissions (from fossil fuel combustion, but also from industrial processes and land use etc.). This makes it a more powerful tool, as you can really see all the options available to you, and all their impacts. 

Many energy models are based on economics, looking at what effect changing prices, demand or supply could have on the market, and in turn what the optimal energy system would be under these circumstances.  These models use complex equations and assumptions about the behaviour of individuals and firms. They are sometimes called “black box” models because inputs go in and outputs come out, but it is not clear what is happening in the middle because they are so complicated. This means that typically only a few experts can properly use them, and consequently trust in them can be low.      

The calculator is different in that it is based more on engineering and physics than on economic forces. Users choose from a range of options for the future without really needing to consider the set of circumstances that would cause them to come about. It avoids any assumptions about what motivates behaviour and instead allows the user to see what the impact of changing behaviour directly would be. It is about what is possible, not what is probable.

The calculator also differs from most models in that it is not a black box. It is as simple as possible, and also as transparent as possible, so the inner workings are not a mystery. Because it is built in Excel, people with no specialist training can open up the model and see the calculations. It also produces answers instantly, rather than taking hours or days to run. 

A marginal abatement cost (MAC) curve is another tool that is often used by economies to look at the mitigation options they have available. This gives a good overview about which options are cheapest, but because it looks at each technology separately, it is does not take into account the co-benefits of combining different actions together. For example, shifting to electric transport can increase emissions if it is not combined with decarbonising the electricity supply. The calculator allows you to see how demand, supply and emissions interact dynamically across sectors, and you can build entire pathways.

While the calculator approach has these advantages over conventional modelling, it does have its drawbacks: 

- It makes no predictions about what will happen in the future. Instead the user can explore their own predictions about the next few decades. 
- Because it is not an economic model, it cannot directly model the potential impact of changes in fuel or carbon prices, new policies or international agreements. This is because there are no automatic correlations between sectors (for example between industrial activity and freight demand) or between cost per unit and energy demand). However, a user could build a pathway that reflected the results of these correlations. Traditional economic models still have an important role to play in policy development, and the UK government continues to use them. The calculator should be seen as another tool in the policy maker’s armoury, rather than a replacement for everything else. 
- Because it has been built as simply as possible, the calculator does remove the fine detail from each sector. For those looking at a particularsector closely, it may not be the right tool to use. The calculator is most valuable when looking at large-scale changes and overall trade-offs, rather than sub-sections of the energy economy.
