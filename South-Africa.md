#Case study: South Africa	
## by Kent Buchanan, Control Environmental Officer, Department of Environmental Affairs, South Africa
South Africa is one of the few countries within the 2050 Calculator community to boast the completion of three outputs: the [2050 Pathways Calculator](http://2050.lateral.co.za), the 2050 Excel workbook and the MY2050 Calculator. These are available online for anyone to access. The 2050 Pathways Calculator and the complementing 2050 Excel workbook, released in March 2014, are aimed for those with a more technical background while the MY2050 Calculator is aimed at people without a technical background including students. 

The journey began in 2012 when representatives from the South African Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) climate change mitigation team (Ms Deborah Ramalope, Chief Director: Climate Change Mitigation and Ms Olga Chauke, Director: Energy Mitigation) were invited to participate in the International 2050 Pathways Conference in China. The South African government found value in the  calculator  as it provides a user-friendly approach to analysing energy systems at a national level.  Because DEA has been entrusted with the national responsibility of sensitising citizens of South Africa around climate change issues, the 2050 pathways Calculator provided an opportunity to do exactly that: it enables users to explore the options for reducing emissions and  understanding the impact of their choices associated thereof. 

When DECC expressed its willingness to provide funding and technical support for countries to adapt the tool, South Africa jumped at the opportunity. Subsequently the DEA signed a memorandum of understanding with the British High Commission and the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change(DECC) to develop the 2050 Pathways calculator for South Africa in Janaury 2013.  Some of the key activities undertaken during the process of developing the tool included: 

*	Dividing the energy system into four sectors (energy , transport, industry and agriculture forestry and land use (AFOLU)
*	Developing an Excel model structure for South Africa (supported by the DECC team) that includes sector specific Excel sheets (compiled by the ERC)
*	Conducting sector specific research (sector leads within the DEA led the process)
*	Stakeholder engagement with sector experts within and outside government to further develop the tool, for example defining levels 1-4. Three workshops that included business, civil society and government officials occurred. 
*	Appointing sector experts to review the 1 pagers and datasheets
*	Building the online webtool

After a year and months of hard work the 2050 Pathways Calculator for South Africa was officially launched by the Director General of the Depament of Environmental affairs on the 26 of March 2014. The development of the 2050 Pathways Calculator was supported by the University of Cape Town’s Energy Research Centre (ERC) who were contracted to build the 2050 Calculator model. Much of the data was based on the South African TIMES model, which is housed at the ERC, and most assumptions were based on specific policy documents.

Our greatest challenges during the development process included gaps in primary data as well as adapting the UK Excel template to suit the context of South Africa. 

The MY2050 Calculator is to be released at the end of  March 2015. This version of the 2050 Calculator sees a reduction in lever options and a bold and attractive online interface where the focus is specifically on greenhouse gas emissions. A thermometer gauge allows the user to track how close they are to the South African GHG emission reduction trajectory Range, commonly known as South Africa’s Peak, Plateau and Decline (PPD) GHG emission trajectory as they try different lever combinations.  The MY2050 application is directly connected to the 2050 Pathways system.

##Using the 2050 Calculators

The 2050 Pathways Calculator as well as the MY2050 Calculator are valuable tools to be used in the public. A primary use of the 2050 Pathways Calculator is to gather input from stakeholder groups on how they envision a low-carbon trajectory up to 2050. This input comes in the form of user-pathways that have been workshoped by the respective stakeholder group. The MY2050 Pathways Calculator is currently being emphasised as a tool to complement Grade 9, 10 and 11 students’ life sciences and geography curricula. A partnership with a government programme that is training teachers in the new environmental education curriculum, Fundisa for Change, is being pursued.

##Lessons learned: Effectively rolling out the 2050 Calculator 

* Before you build the 2050 Calculator have a clear idea of how you want to use the calculator. Is it an educational tool? Is it to assist policy development? Is it a research tool? 
* Early on in the development process investigate synergies with other organisations and government departments. As we have found, there are many initiatives out there that promote low carbon energy futures and partnering with relevant projects or programmes can mutually benefit both. 
*	Develop a ‘living’ communications strategy early on in the development process once the target audience and impact of the calculator has been identified. This strategy will constantly evolve, but the earlier you start, the more advanced the strategy will be to roll out the calculator once it is ready.
*	Our calculator team does not have the resources to efficiently share the calculator at the individual level. We therefore strive to target specific nodes that can further share the calculator with their constituency. For example, we plan to train teachers in charge of relevant subjects (e.g. geography, life sciences etc.) at the provincial level who can then dessiminate the calculator to the teachers at the local level. 
*	The 2050 Calculator is a complex energy model that contains a certain degree of data gaps and it relies on many assumptions. Framing the calculator accurately for the target audience when it is communicated is important to optimise engagements into being constructive. For example, it is important to be transparent with the limitations and remind the audience that this is a scenario building tool.
