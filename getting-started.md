# Getting started

## Building support 

Theoretically a calculator-style model could be built for any country, region or even city by anyone with the necessary time, money and modelling skills; once completed, there is probably an audience that would find such a tool useful, or at least interesting. However, a calculator is really powerful if it is built with support from government from the outset. This focuses the project on the questions that those with influence really want answers to, and also creates a ready-made audience keen to take on board the key messages once it is finished. 

Finding the relevant organisations to engage can be a challenge, as every country or region has its own system. In the UK, responsibility for energy and climate change resides in one single department in government, making it a natural home for such a project. In other countries, the situation might not be so clear. Ask yourself which organisation has responsibility for energy or environmental policies. Perhaps there is one department that has responsibility for long-term planning in general.

Getting a government body to take ownership of the project is extremely important, but remember that you will still need to consult other organisations across government, since the calculator covers everything from building regulations to public transport policy. Involve these people as early as possible so that they feel part of the project. If you only start consulting them once the calculator is built, it is likely that you will not only annoy them, but that you will miss out on the opportunity to learn from their expertise. Using their knowledge to build the calculator is much easier than finding out you’ve made a mistake once it is completed, when it is much harder to change. 

It is likely that a lot of knowledge about the energy system and modelling expertise is held not just in government, but in universities and NGOs. Talking to researchers from all backgrounds can be very helpful. It may be more effective for a government to commission a university or other organisation to do the modelling work for them. For example, the University of Cape Town has built the South Africa calculator in partnership with their Department of Environmental Affairs.

## Building a team

In our experience, a calculator can be built by a core team of between four and seven people. They do not necessarily all have to work full time over the whole of the project – many teams have developed a calculator while continuing to work on other things. 

 The team is usually made up of:

- A project leader – focused on political and stakeholder leadership
- An Excel expert – to bring all the sectors together in to a working tool
- A number of sector leads – to find evidence on one area and engage with expert stakeholders

The project leader will take on a project management role, and will lead on engagement, both within government and with outside stakeholders. They must be able to convince others to get involved and support the work, and must make sure that the calculator is aligned with other government priorities to make it as successful as possible. Organisation and communication skills are very important, and experience of working within government is useful to help understand who needs to be consulted and when.

When choosing an Excel expert, it is perhaps most important to find someone who is very logical and skilled at using Excel, rather than an expert in energy – although if they don’t have a good understanding of how the energy system works before they start, they will have to learn very quickly. Attention to detail is obviously a necessity, as small errors in the detail of the model can become magnified in the final results.

Sector leads should have good research skills, and be able to quickly develop understanding of a particular sector (e.g. transport or electricity generation). They should be able to synthesise a lot of expert views and present their results clearly. The number of sector leads you will need will depend on how you are dividing up the energy system and the particular aims of your model.

## Developing a project plan 

The teams who have successfully built calculators have found that it takes around nine months to build a working first version: three months to secure support and put together a team, and then six months working on the model itself. 

The emphasis should be on launching the calculator as early as possible. One of the great strengths of the calculator approach is that it is open, allowing others to view the whole model and suggest improvements. Releasing it early as a “work in progress” rather than as a finished product means that errors can be found and corrected before any policy is based on its results. Most teams choose to release the first version with a “call for evidence” or a consultation, allowing them to get comments directly from experts in a collaborative (rather than adversarial) way. The model can then be improved and a new version released. 

When drawing up a project plan, it is important to take into account other events that may impact the timeline. Perhaps there is an existing conference that would be perfect to launch the calculator, or perhaps there is a busy period coming up that is best avoided.
