# Appendix X: Whitehalls School conference

The 2050 Calculator team were asked to partake in the annual ‘Whitehall Schools Conference’, delivering an engaging and fun workshop for more than 120 13-14 year olds. They had come from across the country to participate in the event as part of a program to provide talented students from under-represented socio-economic backgrounds an opportunity to visit Whitehall and develop their knowledge of the civil service.

Our role was to present the UK calculator to these school children as part of a group activity in a way to teach them about the effects of climate change and to understand a bit about the UK’s 20% emission target. We were given three sessions with over 30 children, including some teachers, and half an hour to take part in the game.

Using the ‘My 2050’ online tool, we introduced to the group the efforts that the UK government was making to combat carbon emissions. This included the target of reducing carbon emissions by 20% - which was the aim of the game. Simply trying to change the levers to get to this target and explaining why this was necessary. 

We started with the ‘Supply’ part of the simplified tool, going through the more exciting types of clean energy such as wind power, solar and explaining carbon capture. Throughout asking them questions on what they thought was good or bad about each – for example “What are the advantages and disadvantages of nuclear power?” We got some very good answers and managed to engage quite a few of the children in each of the groups. We then moved onto the ‘Demand’ side of the tool which looked at transport, heating and business greenness. It was good to get the audiences opinions on what they thought was a good idea on how to save energy and use the green electricity we would hope to be making.

To do all this and to get a successful outcome, we went through each category on the two supply and demand sections. These categories have levers that you can adjust that will affect the game and reduce the carbon emissions if moved in the right way. So we used a voting system for how far the school children wanted the levers to go up or down; for each category there are 4 levels for how far this will go. Therefore we presented 4 questions to for voting. We had around 16 questions in total, and for some levers we spent more time than others. We spent roughly two minutes on each category, and a bit longer for the more engaging questions at the start about what they understood on climate change. For example, for the category on wind turbines we presented this question to them:

    How many wind turbines should we have in 2050 in the sea? Now we have around 1,000.
    A – None
    B – 10,000
    C – 17,000
    D – 40,000

They all had small remote control buttons to cast their vote (A, B, C or D) and then had 10 seconds to decide. After the countdown the results of the votes appeared on the screen as a chart showing the percentage result of each option. The highest percentage from that was then used to adjust the lever on the 2050 tool. So if it was 2 times more, 3 times more or 4 times more than what the lever was on. 

(Voting buttons can be bought or hired, and were supplied for by the event organisers. Here is an example of what kind of system you would need http://quiztime.biz/voting.html)

By changing the levers we could see the 100% bar begin to drop, this 100% was the amount of carbon emissions that would be in the atmosphere If the government did nothing to try and change the way we use energy. The aim therefore, is to reduce carbon emissions to 20% or less of 1990 by the year 2050. We were able to use this tool to explain this process to them and managed to achieve this 20% goal with all three groups. It was encouraging to see them begin to pick up some of the important ways to reduce emissions, and even more encouraging hearing that some of them had heard of carbon capture, smart meters and loft insulation grants. 

Overall the discussion was successful and was a really interesting and convincing way to demonstrate the tool. It presented, what could be dull information, in a colourful and interactive way. Although we only had half an hour, we think with an hour – and we’ve seen in the past this is the case – that with more time you could engage in better discussions about climate change. The website tool was received well, and next time we will endeavour to promote our ‘My 2050 school toolkit’ (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/my2050-schools-toolkit) which is an excellent resource for schools to use.
